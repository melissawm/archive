# 2020-09-14 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at: https://zoom.us/j/420005230

**Present:** Melissa MendonÃ§a, Daniel Simmons, Ryan Cooper, Ben Nathanson, kubedoc, Matti Picus, Ralf Gommers, Ross Barnowski

## Topics

- GSoD: kickoff! ðŸš€
    - Ryan mentions that he would like to get started creating content for either numpy-tutorials or the main repo.
    - Ralf mentions that it might be easier to direct people to numpy-tutorials, as they can upload content without worrying about reST/Sphinx and then we can convert them to the main repo later.
    - kubedoc mentions that we could try to have a more distributed style of reviews; Matti mentions that it would be helpful to merge earlier, after a first round of review, and if there are outstanding issues we can open new PR's after the merge. Ryan suggests we can note in PR comments whether this is a first PR for the content or if it's a follow-up. This way reviewers know where to focus.
- numpy-tutorials: updates 
    - README: https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/27
    - How-tos: https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/16 and https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/15: can we merge?
    - nbval for testing/validating notebooks: https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/26
    - ReviewNB is already setup; suggestions for different workflows are welcome
- @cooperrc update for the NumPy for MATLAB users doc: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17159
- @cooperrc's idea of a tutorial on saving/loading Hilbert matrices: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17266
    - Should we have two documents about I/O? The tutorial is more focused on a real use case, while the How-to is more a description of possible solutions to the use-cases.
    - will add a comment on changing the Hilbert workflow to a load csv and linear regression workflow
- In progress: @bjnath's update of the glossary: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17263
- kubedoc: started working on the neural network (a mini library) in NumPy tutorial with `ndarray` serving as a "tensor", got another OK from another author to use their material
    - Ideas: 
        - Later on: for an advanced tutorial (?) - can show how to create a proper tensor class and go into more detail
        - Should we port anything from SciPy? <- reorganizing and updating (e.g. best practices, which functions to use, etc)
            - e.g. SciPy - Image processing and other advanced NumPy material:
                -  http://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/image_processing/index.html
                -  http://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/advanced_numpy/index.html 
                    -  If it adds to reference docs - that makes sence (without diplicating)
                    -  Maybe we could link to them with InterSphinx (https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html)? E.g. "For more information, link ..."
                        -  Make sure it's modernized - we could add PRs to the scipy-lectures repo to help keep it up-to-date
                        -  Command to check intersphinx labels: for example, for Python:
                        `python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx https://docs.python.org/3/objects.inv > output.txt`
        - How-to guides: 
            - Can we port/borrow ideas from scikit-images (since images are NumPy arrays)?
                - e.g. scikit-image - NumPy for images user guide:
                    - https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/user_guide/numpy_images.html
            - A how-to for image processing: video-to-GIF with OpenCV and NumPy (using the `cv2` module, `np.array`, `np.clip`)
- Reviewer guidelines for main NumPy repo: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17252 (feedback is welcome!)
