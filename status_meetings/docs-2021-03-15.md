## Topics

- [Google Season of Docs 2021](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs); [Admin guide](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/admin-guide)
    - Create opencollective.com account by April 30
    - Create a project proposal page and publicize (our channels and the GSoD github) - as soon as possible
    - Key deliverable: [publicly available case study](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/case-study)
    - [Project ideas (draft)](https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/rkRhYd5zu)
    - Suggestions and ideas are welcome - this is still in discussion!
    - Matt suggests a possible future project creating an interactive book/documentation system (Ryan mentions this reference: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654312436980?journalCode=rera)
        - [Chem Eng video game: Contents under pressure](https://stemforall2020.videohall.com/presentations/1691)
        - [Cards against Engineering Ethics](https://www.aiche.org/conferences/aiche-annual-meeting/2017/proceeding/paper/312a-cards-against-humanity-style-card-game-increasing-engineering-students-awareness-ethical-issues)

- [numpy-tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials)
    - Ross will update the issue with the discussion on deployment; Melissa will make a PR against numpy.org to include links to the tutorials. We will give this another week to review the current tutorials and make sure the content/formatting is right.
    - MNIST tutorial: kubedoc proposes to change the data source (sklearn); Ross mentions that this is not the best solution because the file format is not ideal. Keeping the data ourselves would be the best solution, but we need to figure out how to do this without including the complete dataset in the source repo. This should be solved (in the future) with a centralized data sources repo for scientific python projects
    - Pong tutorial: will be merged soon
    - Static Equilibrium: under review
- Youtube:
    - Is a [brand account](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9367690?hl=en) what we want?
        - Matthias: Jupyter has a brand account, it's relatively straitforward to manage. Would a brand account larger than numpy (Numfocus? Pydata?) be worth it?
        - Matt mentions the [YouTube Creator's Manual](https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/discovery)
- Tracking issue for making the NumPy Docs more accessible
    - Current scope: [User Guide pages](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html?highlight=user%20guide) for color-blindness and screen-readers
    - Getting a high-level report: doing it ourselves with free tools vs paying a company to review
        - Considerations: Cost (subscription API or stand-alone payment), discount for open-source projects, turn-around time, number of pages, report format, communication after receiving report
        - Current companies we're looking at: WAVE, AudioEye
    - Sphinx team are fixing upstream issues from theme (eg. all page headers have color-contrast issues)
- Better docs from within IPython/Jupyter.
    - Papyri demo maybe (Matthias)
    - Want to follow allong (at your own risk).
        - ``$ pip install papyri``
        - ``$ papyri install numpy scipy``
        - ``$ ipython --ext papyri.ipython``
        - ``>>> import numpy``
        - ``>>> numpy.linspace?``
    - nuke ``~/.papyri`` if you ever uninstall it.
