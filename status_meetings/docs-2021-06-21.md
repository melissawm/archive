## Topics

- GSoD updates
    - [Broadcasting](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19136)
    - [Indexing](https://github.com/Mukulikaa/numpy/issues/3)
    - Matti suggests cleaning up the [random number API docs/user guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/index.html), [Random reference docs](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/generator.html)


- what happens when you search google/duckduckgo for numpy devdocs? I sometimes get https://devdocs.io/numpy~1.19/
    - This looks to be a [freeCodeCamp project](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs)
    - We should add a link to the "canonical" docs at the Welcome message in our devdocs. 
    - Another idea is to add a top banner in our theme that only renders when not in the numpy.org site.
    - In [the devdocs Github repo]([https://](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs)), it looks like there are PRs for small documentation fixes ([such as for Nim](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs)) if anyone wants to make changes on the devdocs side
    - There are similar Github issues such as for [C++](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/issues/1560), but not sure if the C++ maintainer or devdoc maintainer makes this change

- Numpy Tutorials
    - [Github issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19191)
    - Reorganize current sphinx tutorials into numpy-tutorials or NumPy Fundamentals seems to be the best solution
    - Investigate how to use tags to organize the contents (Melissa will check for sphinx extensions to do that)

- Docs building
    - Ross brings up a problem with the docs build because of the pinned sphinx version in our environment.yml/doc_requirements.txt files. A quick fix would be to un-pin sphinx and [disable the collapsible navbar](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/364) to reduce the build times.
