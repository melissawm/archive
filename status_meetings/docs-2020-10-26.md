# 2020-10-26 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at:  https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09

**Present:** Melissa Mendon√ßa, Ryan Cooper, Ross Barnowski, Anne Bonner, kubedoc, Matti Picus, Al-Baraa El-Hag, Ben Nathanson

## Topics

- GSoD check:
    - Ryan: 
        - [Moore's Law tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/31) - [ReviewNB link](https://app.reviewnb.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/31)
        - [IO Tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/34)
        - _propose explanation/reference spaces_?
        - Matti mentions that there is a way to remove explanations from a docstring, so that is it built separately in the html rendered docs but still included in the actual docstring (_i might have misunderstood_)
        - kubedoc asks if there is an optimal way to identify those explanations; Ryan and kubedoc might coordinate on this
        - Ryan mentions there were issues left with the NumPy for Matlab users document. Might need a follow-up (either a separate document, which format - tutorial, how to?)
        - Melissa will merge the Moore's Law tutorial and we'll continue the review once Ross's workflow is merged, so we don't rely on ReviewNB.
    - kubedoc:
        - [Deep learning from scratch tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/33)
            - kubedoc is working on the feedback, and mentions maybe changing the dataset. Matti mentions it might be best to focus first on the content and not worry about the specific dataset in use. The dataset change can be done as a follow-up PR.
        - [NumPy deep reinforcement learning with Pong from pixels](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/35)
            - This is an adaptation from an existing document. This is a longer-form document that includes some explanations about the research on deep reinforcement learning itself.
            - kubedoc mentions also working on a how to in the next few weeks

- numpy-tutorials workflow?
  * Example on rossbar's fork: https://github.com/rossbar/numpy-tutorials
    - What the site could look like (from a style POV): https://rossbar.github.io/numpy-tutorials/
    - [Workflow example](https://github.com/rossbar/numpy-tutorials/pull/2): borrowed Melissa's PR on `tutorial-ma`
      * Review the `md` file through the normal GH interface
      * Run & rendered output available via CI (re-run on each push)
      * Notebooks auto-generated as part of build, but not used in review. Never a point where the deployed site is out-of-sync with the notebooks.
  * PR to `numpy/numpy-tutorials` incoming

- Next meeting: weekly? (when2meet) <- we'll continue the discussion on slack

- [TikZ for diagrams](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17556): is this ok? <- Matti mentions that this might work, but we need an SVG output.

### For next meeting 

- Remove most of the general git tutorial pages (not related to NumPy) in `dev/gitwash` (Ben)
    - Out of date
    - Out of scope
    - Too much to maintain

- Clarify rebase instructions in [Development workflow](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/development_workflow.html#rebasing-on-master) (Ben)
    - Unclear what situation requires a rebase
    - Poor instructions on handling conflicts
    - Has sent me over a cliff more than once
    - I'd fix it if I knew the answers

- GitHub [project page for docs](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/): Bury it or revive it? (Ben)
