# 2021-02-01 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 4pm UTC
- Join via Zoom at: [link](https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09)

**Present:** Melissa Mendonça, Matti Picus, Mars, kubedoc, Charles Stern, Ryan Cooper

## Topics

- numpy-tutorials
    - [Authorship fix](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/59) - waiting for feedback
    - Charles mentions he may be able to create a document (either a tutorial or HowTo) on geospatial analysis
    - kubedoc mentions he is working in a tutorial involving sound processing; he asks about playback and if that would bring problems to the site. This should be fine as long as the right dependencies are set for building the site.
- Videos
    - Create playlist for the YouTube channel
    - Melissa will talk to Stéfan, Ralf or NumFOCUS about login credentials for NumPy 
    - Organize a private repo with those credentials for NumPy?
- Adding or updating current or future visual content (Mars)
    - such as diagrams and illustrations
    - Example of previous diagram update (https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/37#issuecomment-739036755)
    - kubedoc mentioned https://mathinspector.com - this may be a good starting point for some of the illustrations we are thinking about adding to the docs
    - GIFs may be more complicated to include in the main docs, because they would have to ship with the NumPy source code.
- CZI grant
    - As a part of the CZI grant, suggestions about high-level explanations are welcome. One topic that Melissa will prioritize is interoperability.
- SIMD documentation: 
    - [Is this a good example/explanation to add?](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16763)
