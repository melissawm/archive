- Time: 4pm UTC
- Join via Zoom at: [link](https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09)

**Present:** Melissa Mendon√ßa, Isabela Presedo-Floyd, kubedoc, Mars Lee, Matti Picus, Lev Maximov, Ryan Cooper, Daniele Procida, Matt Calhoun, Christopher Holdgraf

## Topics

- Daniele Procida gently proposes a workshop around his documentation framework; maybe we could think of a cross-project workshop
    - Lowest hanging fruit: How-to's? landing page?
        - 1) Re-structure the front page so it's obvious where is the next step once you land there, ([Github issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18419))
        - 2) Think about the user personas that come to the docs, and design a pathway for discovery+learning for each
        - @choldgraf
    - most important doc issue right now: \_\_\_?
- We had a discussion on the scope of the documentation (should we explain the math behind NumPy or not?) We talked about having a more concise approach, but including references when possible. Deeper explanations might be appropriate for numpy-tutorials
- We also talked about possibly creating a "planet" to index interesting content about NumPy from medium, blogs etc
- [Google Season of Docs 2021: proposal submitted](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2021:-Submitted-Project)
- [numpy-tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials) update
- YouTube: [we have a NumPy channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCguIL9NZ7ybWK5WQ53qbHng) :tada:
- General updates
- Compiling resources for future contributors on editing SVG graphics for the NumPy documentation
    -  How SVGs code relates to graphic software tools (using the path tool vs shape tool, how to minimize code by using the better tool thus minimizing number of points. For example, drawing a curve with 2 points vs 12 points)
        -  Isabela is interested in this and will follow up.
