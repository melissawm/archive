## Topics

- Updating the Docs landing page
    - [Github issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18419)
    - Newest mock-up is for the Getting Started Guides
        - Defining the user profile for each guide
    - Next mock-up is for the User Guides page
        - Another landing page for tutorials, how-tos and fundamentals. 
    - Prototype 
        - Put all the mockups on a clickable online prototype, so we can see how everything is linked together and keep to the '3 clicks max' rule for each user joruney
    - Matt brings up it would be useful to set up analytics to track user behavior on the website; Melissa will follow up on that with the web team (or anyone who can help with the set up)
    - Juan mentions the [sphinx-panels extension](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-panels) that could be a good fit for our pages. Ross mentions it´s a good idea to reduce the amount of hard-coded html/css. Mars may open a separate issue to discuss specific implementation details. Pandas does implement their [landing page via .rst](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/source/index.rst.template
)

- Daniele Procida's workshop (tentative date: May 5th)

    - Google will share chosen projects on April 16
- [160+ open docs issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/04%20-%20Documentation)
- Report on NumPy documentation accessibility
    - Mars will compare different vendors on accessibility tracking tools so we can maybe spend funds on doing this assessment. kubedoc will ask around on the Write the Docs slack. Isabela my also have ideas.  Mars may open a separate issue about factors and considerations from today's meeting.
    - Since we are using the PyData Sphinx theme, does [#206](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/206) help?
- numpy tutorials update: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18758 :tada:
    - PR to numpy.org to follow

For next meeting:
- Numpy Docs Graphics Guide: Best practices and accessibility guidelines
    - Standardizing file type to SVG
