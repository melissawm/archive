**Present:** Melissa MendonÃ§a, Ross Barnowski, Ryan Cooper, Mars Lee, Mukulika, Matti Picus

## Topics

- Duplicate TOC sections in left navbar 
[in devdocs](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html), NumPy [issue 19028](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19028)
    - Ross suggests digging into it to find out if this is a bug or a feature by the pydata-sphinx-theme, and then fix it.

- Documentation issues and the 1.22 release?
[documentation issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/04%20-%20Documentation)
    - Do some triage and close irrelevant issues
    - Try to list PRs and issues needing responses and move them forward (either close, merge or branch to a new issue)

- Implementing [changes to Docs front page](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18419#issuecomment-832232691)
  - Difficulty building Sphinx docs with Windows
    - (Mars' experience) Attempted Gitbash, Windows Command Line, Cygwin, Msys2...
    - Main difficulty is Windows not coming with Make build tool, building virtual environment, maintaining versions
	- Update [build guide for NumPy reference and docs](https://numpy.org/devdocs/docs/howto_build_docs.html)?
	  - Recommend Gitpod for Window users? -> at least link to gitpod documentation from the "how to build docs" page
		- For people unfamiliar with command line, have internet connection
      - More people have success with WSL- suggest the Windows app version?
        - For people who want to work locally, more persistent beyond Gitpod's 14-day inactvitiy period
      - Write an 'explanation burb' why build NumPy to build docs? Or else you get an error message

  - Successfully ran with Gitpod using [NumPy docs guide on Gitpod](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_gitpod.html)
    - Create crosslinks: On the [Build NumPy from source](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/building.html) and [Build Docs](https://numpy.org/devdocs/docs/howto_build_docs.html) page, make a link to Gitpod guide

- mathjax
   - Look for possible ways to avoid submodules

- [Tutorials in main docs](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/tutorials_index.html): suggestions for naming?
   - Guides?
       - Maybe needs a descriptor- such as 'Concept Guides'
   - Lessons?
       - Emphasizes the broken-down, in-depth information
       - But don't to make this feel like a neccessary series of lessons to follow before trying NumPy
   - Deep-dive? 
       - American-English slang, not accessible globally
   - Internals 
       - Already used elsewhere in NumPy docs
   - Consolidate tutorials?
   - Ross to open discussion issue
