# 2021-01-04 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at:  https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09

**Present:** Melissa, Matti, kubedoc, Ryan, Maximiliano

## Topics

- Start of a new CZI grant :tada:
    - You can read the full proposal here: https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Improving_usability_and_sustainability_for_NumPy_and_OpenBLAS/13269167
- numpy-tutorials: deployment and repository status
    - [Author tags](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues/57)
        - How do we manage subsequent edits to existing tutorials? Are all contributors listed as authors? Here is a typical [pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) with a single attribution line. 
        - We should be careful to note both to authors and contributors that the documents can be changed later, not just by the author.
        - This should be limited to 1-3 names for each document. It is still not clear how this should be decided. Some further research is needed.
        - Another solution would be to re-write the history of .md file commits to get the correct authorship for tutorials.
    - [Deploy via circleCI to gh-pages branch](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/50)
        - Once this PR is merged we can fix the redirect to get a nice url 

- kubedoc: Ideas (from 2020 + new)
    - Basic meta-agnostic meta-learning: learning to learn ML with NumPy (building on work on deep learning with NumPy)
    - Intro to partial differential equations with NumPy
        - [Cooper - Boundary Value Guitar solutions](https://github.uconn.edu/rcc02007/CompMech05-BVPs/blob/master/notebooks/03_Good_Vibrations.ipynb)
    - A tutorial/how-to for working with audio data with NumPy (with Librosa and music21)
    - NumPy interoperability with JAX

- Video idea: setting up a NumPy dev environment with WSL2 (Matti)
