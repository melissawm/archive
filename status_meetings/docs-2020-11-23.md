- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at:  https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09

**Present:** Melissa Mendon√ßa, Ariel, Al-Baraa El-Hag, kubedoc, Daniel Simmons, Ryan Cooper, Mars Lee, Matti Picus

## Topics

- GSoD check: last week!
    - kubedoc: 
        - [Tutorial: NumPy X-ray image processing](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/38) - almost ready to merge
        - [Tutorial: NumPy deep learning on MNIST from scratch](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/33) - pending conversion to new format
        - [Tutorial: NumPy deep reinforcement learning with Pong from pixels](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/35)
        - kubedoc may work on an autodiff tutorial using NumPy, and a second doc discussing audio manipulation. Melissa mentions that she may have some material to be used for the second doc.
    - Ryan:
        - [Array creation docs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17710) will become a tutorial _explanation?_
        - Al Baraa will write a array-creation-overflow HowTo
        - Re-label NumPy basics as "Fundamentals" or "Explanations"
        - Re-organize the landing page (get docs to be accessible there) - update User Guide TOC
        - Work on the README for the numpy-tutorials repo about converting ipynb to md through jupytext

- numpy-tutorials workflow: what's missing?
    - Ryan asks about MystNB vs. JupyterBook (we'll discuss this with Ross)

- Pending PR's:
    - [Moore's Law tutorial with new format](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/44): pending formatting questions
    - [Organizing tutorial resources and outputs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/45)
    - [Solving DC circuits using numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/37)
        - Mars' suggestion: Update hand-drawn diagrams?

- Al might work on a HowTo for creating NumPy functions, showing how to contribute. Matti mentions that may be useful for his DataUmbrella talk on Dec 2nd.

- Ryan has been advising students on writing tutorials, so we may see some new tutorials in the next few weeks
