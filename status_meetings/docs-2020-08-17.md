## Topics

- GSoD winners announced yesterday (Ben)
    - NumPy was awarded two slots. Ryan Cooper and kubedoc will be working with us
    - [Ryan Cooper proposal](https://hackmd.io/@cooperrc/BJTwgETjU) https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/project-numpy-cooperrc
        - contact: @cooperrc github.com
    - kubedoc proposal
        - https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/project-numpy-kubedoc:
            - Create and improve high-level documentation—Tutorials and How-Tos—covering topics that are missing from the official documentation.
            - Create a new Explanations section, organizing the content currently scattered through the reference documentation.

- Docs restructuring, Phase 1 (Ben): Move docs relating to the NumPy project from Sphinx pages to numpy.org. 
    -  Reasons: 
        -  [numpy.org has already started covering this](https://numpy.org/about/); we should choose one place or the other
        -  it would be good to reduce the bulk of the Sphinx docs
        -  this information is not related to the numpy code
    -  What would move:
        -  [NumPy project governance and decision-making](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/governance/governance.html)
        -  [Current steering council and institutional partners](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/governance/people.html)
        -  Proposal: [NEPs](https://numpy.org/neps/) would remain in their current form as Sphinx docs but they would no longer be incorporated in releases; they'd be linked to from numpy.org. Logically they're part of the project, not part of the release.
            -  The priority is to have the NEP's searchable. For the moment they don't have to be necessarily moved.
        -  [Release notes](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release.html)? On one hand, why should the docs for release X describe what's in every previous release? On the other, release X does need its own release notes, and it may be more work than necessary to split them. 
            -  Ralf notes it is important to keep previous versions for information purposes.
        -  [License](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/license.html) stays with Sphinx docs
    -  This is a good proposal and looks reasonable. Ralf notes we would like to avoid making the numpy.org page too big, as we're planning on having translations for all those pages. The sphinx docs won't be translated.
    - What's our plan for handling broken links from this and upcoming site reorganizations?
        - Ralf points out that the governance page can just be moved. Matti mentions that we could have stub documents to redirect the pages, but Ralf says that might be too much work and we might just want to move the pages without worrying too much.
    - [Sketch of a final layout for docs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6691888/90408227-92635400-e075-11ea-923b-4c240af428c8.png)

- As a note: the numpy.docs namespace is about to be removed. That is an outdated structure that should be replaced by a better organization of the content.
- Ryan mentions he would like to work on an update of the "NumPy for MATLAB users" document.
- kubeflow's proposal: material on NumPy for users who want to work on data science and machine learning problems
