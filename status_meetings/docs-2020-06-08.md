# 2020-06-08 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at: https://zoom.us/j/420005230

**Present:** Melissa MendonÃ§a, Ben Nathanson, Themistoklis Spanoudis, Ross Barnowski, Guilherme Leobas, Ryan Cooper, Mohona

## Topics
- [Making notebooks executable](https://github.com/bjnath/numpy_ipynb) via linking to the ipynb (e.g. [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb), [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) (Ben) 
    - Ross and Melissa note that Binder might be a better community fit for NumPy. We might try AAto see if common markdown is compatible with Colab. 
    - Check out if JupyterHub could be used (maybe faster than Binder for loading the notebooks?) 
    - A downside of many of these services is that users must log in to use them.

- [numpy-tutorials repo](github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials): 
    - how about using the config Ross is proposing [here](https://github.com/rossbar/sample_notebook_tutorials_site)? This is using Myst, and can be configured with different templates and can also provide MyBinder links for each notebook; maybe add gitpod to the workflow (see if this is feasible). 
    - For downloading notebooks, the PyData sphinx theme provides a button for users; having a download script button for the notebooks is also important (perhaps using the nbconvert extension)
    - Check out Jupytercache (part of the Executable Books project: https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/)
    - Maybe reconsider the name? `numpy-cookbook` is a good suggestion by Ben, but might clash with the existing [SciPy Cookbook](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/). Ask on NumPy/SciPy mailing lists. `numpy-recipes` is also a nice suggestion!

- Should we adopt a [consistent tutorial style](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bjnath/numpy_ipynb/blob/master/tutorial-svd_gh.ipynb) -- c.f. [Google codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-iot-core-overview/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)? (Ben)
    - This is a great idea and would be helpful for new contributors
    - Would be interesting to have either a guide or a template for people to follow (Ben might look into this)

- Discuss [Ryan Cooper's proposal](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2020-May/080715.html) to add NumPy notebooks via student projects; here are [more details](https://www.mail-archive.com/numpy-discussion@python.org/msg04101.html). (Ben)
    - All agree this would be super valuable. Melissa will get the repo organized so this is feasible.

- Follow up on last week's discussion of a centralized docs project (Ben) -> maybe revive SciPy Cookbook?
    - Probably easier to think of a "core" ecosystem first: SciPy+NumPy+matplotlib. Would be significantly harder to get too many projects involved at the same time.

- Change meetings frequency to every two weeks.
