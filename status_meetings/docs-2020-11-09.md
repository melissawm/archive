# 2020-11-09 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at:  https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09

**Present:** Melissa MendonÃ§a, Mars Lee, Al-Baraa El-Hag, kubedoc, Ryan Cooper, Ross Barnowski, Matti Picus

## Topics

- GSoD check: technical writing phase ends on November 30
    - kubedoc asked about having open PR's when the timeline ends. All agree that we don't need to have everything merged by then, as long as people involved are available to review/make changes after then.
    - Ryan:
        - opened [issue #17710](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17710) to update [Array Creation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.creation.html)
        - Ryan also mentions maybe opening a PR to rename the NumPy "Basics" section of the user guide - to Fundamentals or something more appropriate. We mentioned being aware that this might break links for other projects and pages, but we agreed that this is not a blocker for that renaming.
        - Ryan might work on another 2 documents before the end of GSoD
        - @cooperrc: build a document for numpy-tutorials to help new users submit md version of ipynb
    - kubedoc:
        - 3 docs in review:
            - [Tutorial: NumPy X-ray image processing](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/38) -> new
            - [Tutorial: NumPy deep reinforcement learning with Pong from pixels](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/35)
            - [Tutorial: NumPy deep learning on MNIST from scratch](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/33)

- Al's tutorial: [Solving DC circuits using numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/37)

- numpy-tutorials workflow [ref. PR #36](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/36)?
    - @cooperrc uses these two commands to switch between ipynb and md:
        - `jupytext --to=md notebook.ipynb`
        - `jupytext --to=ipynb --from=md --update --output notebook.ipynb notebook.md`
    - The notebook.md/ipynb renders in Jupyter/GitHub/HTML
        - uses commonmark
    - Using [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use/myst.html)-specific 
        -formatting only works well in HTML
        -superset of myst-markdown

- NumPy User Guide discussion (@cooperrc)
    - @bjnath has some great ideas for updating NumPy.basics ("integrate Basics, Quickstart, and the deeper explanatory articles into a set of readable subject articles. Each of the new articles will be useful to users at all levels... _Fix the duplication one article at a time_")
    - general ranking? e.g. is there an order that these should be approached?
