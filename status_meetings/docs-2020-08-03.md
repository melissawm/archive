# 2020-08-03 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at: https://zoom.us/j/420005230

**Present:** Melissa Mendon√ßa, Ben Nathanson, Mrinal Tyagi, kubedoc, Ryan Cooper, Ralf Gommers, Matti Picus

## Topics

- I/O How-To (Melissa - see https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15760 and https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/14 - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/15)
    - First approach (by Melissa): quite narrative, tutorial-like
    - Second approach (by Ben): recipe-like, with almost no notes/explanations.
    - kubedoc mentions other how-to styles and examples that may be useful when doing our version.
    - Ralf suggests we start with questions people might want answered, and the how-to means to answer those questions.
    - Ralf will review Ben's how-to
    - The suggestion for now is to commit how-tos and other documents in the numpy-tutorials repo, render them as binder links and add dependencies as necessary. 

- numpy-tutorials update (Melissa)

- Mrinal suggests looking at this Pandas tutorial: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html#concatenating-objects

- To organize suggestions for subjects for future documents, Ralf will add a how-to label for github issues.
    - This issue is an example of what a topic suggestion would be like: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15760
