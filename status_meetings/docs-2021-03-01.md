## Topics

- [Google Season of Docs 2021](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs); [Admin guide](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/admin-guide)
    - Create opencollective.com account by April 30
    - Create a project proposal page and publicize (our channels and the GSoD github) - as soon as possible
    - Key deliverable: [publicly available case study](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/case-study)
    - [Project ideas (draft)](https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/rkRhYd5zu)
    - Suggestions and ideas are welcome - this is still in discussion!
- [numpy-tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials)
    - No solution for ~~deployment~~ redirecting the url right now; netlify not an option. We should just publicize the current URL. 
    - Ross will update the issue with the discussion on deployment; Melissa will make a PR against numpy.org to include links to the tutorials. We will give this another week to review the current tutorials and make sure the content/formatting is right.
    - Should we make the logo at numpy.org/numpy-tutorials link to the main docs or to the index of tutorials? (we should not change the logo without a design discussion)
    - Ross proposes removing the CS231 tutorial since we have now populated the repo with our own tutorials :)
- [Tracking Issue for Updating and Adding Documentation Graphics](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18501)
    - First added issue: [I/O how-to needs a visual aid](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17517)
    - Make sure the graphics are reproducible and programmatically generated (if possible)
    - This is an open discussion and we would like input from the community
- use `sphinx-last-updated-by-git` Sphinx extension? [PR 18268](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18268)
    - The team agrees that the best solution would be to remove the "Last updated by" information from the footer of every page, but keeping it on the landing page.
