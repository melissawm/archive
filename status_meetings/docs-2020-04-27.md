# 2020-04-27 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at: https://zoom.us/j/420005230

**Present:** Melissa Mendonça, Ralf Gommers, Guilherme Leobas, Ben Nathanson, Maja, Ryan Cooper, Tarcísio Fischer, Bennet Fauber

## Topics

- Updates from Melissa
    - [PR: How to help document NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16069): almost done
    - [PR: numpy.ma tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/15791) pending with some questions about encoding and plot files. Is it better to start thinking about the Jupyter notebooks repo instead of Sphinx for this kind of content?
    - IO with NumPy + Zarr (How To): in progress (decided on dataset: [CMIP6 stands for Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, a project that is part of the World Climate Research Program](https://medium.com/pangeo/cmip6-in-the-cloud-five-ways-96b177abe396))

- [Proposal for Google Season of Docs](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2020-Project-Ideas): will submit in the next few days - last days to read and make suggestions!
    - Maja suggest adding the results to the user survey 

- Jupyter notebook tutorials repo
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials
  - Jupytext vs. [reviewnb](https://www.reviewnb.com/): Jupytext needs to be a pre-commit hook which might be problematic for inexperienced users. 
  - Matplotlib has notebook downloads --> that is Sphinx-gallery. TODO: look back at SciPy thread on this, why wasn't sphinx-gallery sufficient?

- GitPod docs dev setup?
    - Who would use it? --> yes, people will use it; complementary to notebooks

- Datasets package for tutorials
    - Intake catalog
    - Melissa will look into downloader (Pooch?)
    - Find a name:) `pydatasets`?

- Case studies on website
    - If you have ideas, feel free to open an issue on the numpy.org repo (even if the idea is incomplete)

- Team gallery & Documentation team membership

- Notebooks from Ryan https://github.uconn.edu/rcc02007/CompMech04-LinearAlgebra 

- Link from Bennet https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016/ 
- Tutorial text from Bennet, adapted from several day tutorial https://justbennet.github.io/pyregress/index.html
